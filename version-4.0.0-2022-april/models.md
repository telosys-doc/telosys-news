# Models

Since version 4.0.0 there is **only one type of model**: the **DSL model**.&#x20;

The DSL model has been enhanced to support all functionality previously available only in "db-model", thus the "db-model" is no longer useful.&#x20;

**Annotations** and **tags** are now usable at **entity** level.

It is possible to create a new DSL model from a database schema (as for the previous "db-model")&#x20;

The DSL model has a new structure: \
each model is completely contained in a directory. \
It is more convenient to exchange and store models.&#x20;

See: [https://doc.telosys.org/dsl-model](https://doc.telosys.org/dsl-model)

Many new annotations have been added to enrich the DSL model.&#x20;

The DSL model offers now 55 annotations.

# Version 4.0.0 (2022-April)

### Models

Since version 4 there is only one type of model: the DSL model.

The DSL model has been enhanced to support all functionality previously available only in "db-model", thus the "db-model" is no longer useful.

It is possible to create a new DSL model from a database schema (as for the previous "db-model")

The DSL model has a new structure: each model is completely contained in a directory. It is more convenient to exchange and store models.

Many new annotations have been added to enrich the DSL model.\
